      NCastor contains a set of pre-defined MSBuild scripts to allow you quickly INTEGRATE your
      application with a CI server, using free popular third-party tools, 
      allowing you to set assembly information to your files, auto increment build and
      revision version, run "NUnit", "MSTest" or "MSpec" tests with code coverage results
      using "OpenCover" generate reports from the results using "Report Generator", run code analysis using "StyleCop" 
      run assembly analysis using "FxCop", generate reports for the "StyleCop" and "FxCop" results, generate zip files 
      for your source code, build files, tests reports, code coverage reports, static analysis reports, package 
      your application using "ClickOnce", "WXI" (Windows XML Installer) and creates a custom "Nuget" package.
      
      NCastor INTEGRATES popular third party tools to build the scripts for you. NCastor will be a
      wrapper for these tools and expose a simple configuration for you.
