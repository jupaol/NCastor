"Your stuff"

Your Prepare Nuget package targets
-->

<Project DefaultTargets="All" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">

  <!--TODO: Place here your Prepare Nuget package targets-->

  <!--
    We will use as references the examples provided in the BuildSpecialProjects targets:
      MyNugetPackageOutputPath
      AnotherNugetPackageOutputPath
  -->

  <!--
  The "CorePrepareNugetPackages" is the target that should be overriden
  <Target 
    Name="CorePrepareNugetPackages" 
    DependsOnTargets="
          PrepareMyNugetPackage;
          PrepareAnotherNugetPackage;" />

  <Target Name="PrepareMyNugetPackage">

    Since we specified this project as an special project, we already have the output of that project ready to be customized
    Deleting files we do nto want to include in the Nuget package
    <Delete Files="$(MyNugetPackageOutputPath)\*.tmp" />

    Adding important files to the Nuget package
    <MSBuild.ExtensionPack.FileSystem.RoboCopy
      Source="$(GlobalRootPath)"
      Destination="$(MyNugetPackageOutputPath)"
      Files="*.md;"/>

    Here we specify the properties used to create the Nuget package (The output is automatically set to the $(DropsPath))
    <ItemGroup>
      <NugetPackages Include="MyNugetPackage.nuspec">
        <SourcePath>$(MyNugetPackageOutputPath)</SourcePath>
        <ExtraOptions></ExtraOptions>
        <Version>$(SemanticVersion)</Version>
      </NugetPackages>
    </ItemGroup>
    In the "ExtraOptions" metadata, you can specify Nuget console custom commands

  </Target>

  Creating another Nuget
  <Target Name="PrepareAnotherNugetPackage">

    <Delete Files="$(AnotherNugetPackageOutputPath)\useless.file.tmp" />

    <ItemGroup>
      <NugetPackages Include="AnotherNugetPackage.nuspec">
        <SourcePath>$(AnotherNugetPackageOutputPath)</SourcePath>
        <ExtraOptions></ExtraOptions>
        <Version>$(SemanticVersion)</Version>
      </NugetPackages>
    </ItemGroup>
