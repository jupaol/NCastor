# Welcome to the NCastor AutoBuilder site #

## What is it? ##

NCastor AutoBuilder is a set of MSBuild scripts built to be reusable across projects, the scripts wrap popular third party tools by exposing a simple configuration for you and hiding the complexity to integrate them in a MSBuild script. 

The result: when you use NCastor AutoBuilder you can integrate quickly your project with practically any Continuous Integration server.

NCastor AutoBuilder contains pre-built tasks that are common to most of the projects like: create version information, build, run tests, run tests with code coverage, generate tests reports and code coverage reports, create labels in your VCS, packing the generated artifacts in zip files or Nuget files and build your installers
